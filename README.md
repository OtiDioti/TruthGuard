# TruthGuard
This program aims to check whether a certain piece of information is correct or not. Note that this is not meant to provide a definite answer on any piece of information; rather, this project is something I implemented to keep myself occupied and practice my skills with API calls, chat GPT and Vector Embedding. For a deployed version of the app click [here](https://truthguard.streamlit.app).
